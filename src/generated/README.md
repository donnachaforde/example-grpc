Generated stubs will be generated to this location. The `protobuf` code generated is used to read the interface definition and the `protos` Visual Studio project will invoke the `protoc` generator to create both the `protobuf` and `grpc` stubs. 

Note: Compiler warning C4251 disabled in the project properties.
